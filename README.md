# tortoise-tts-guide

Tortoise (TorToiSe) TTS is one of the best TTS (text-to-speech) programs available. In fact, it is even rumored to power the popular ElevenLabs TTS service.

Tortoise TTS is remarkably slow, however there are several enhancements we can use to speed it up.

Before we begin: I do NOT endorse any repo/website/etc linked here. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!

Tortoise TTS recently gained a new maintainer, @manmay-nakhashi. Before becoming the Tortoise maintainer, he created [`tortoise-tts-fastest`](https://github.com/manmay-nakhashi/tortoise-tts-fastest), a fork of [`tortoise-tts-fast`](https://github.com/152334H/tortoise-tts-fast). The author of `tortoise-tts-fast`, @152334H, [works for ElevenLabs](https://github.com/152334H) and created a forked version of [`DL-Art-School`](https://github.com/152334H/DL-Art-School). `DL-Art-School` was originally created by the author of Tortoise TTS, however he did not release finetuning code due to ["ethical"](https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts/discussions/292#discussioncomment-4876055) and legal concerns. The forked version supports finetuning Tortoise TTS, which we will use in the fine-tuning section.

## Inference

To start Inference, we will use `tortoise-tts-fastest`.
